# Seattle React.js Meetup Presentation - Apollo
This is my presentation about the GraphQL integration library, Apollo.

I'll go into some detail about what GraphQL is and does, but you should probably have some basic idea of what it does and how it works before starting to work with any integration library.

You should DEFINITELY know what React is and have a basic idea of how it's structured.

Knowing a little bit about Redux would probably help as well, but isn't strictly necessary.

Then we'll talk about what Apollo does and doesn't do and talk at a high level how it actually works.

And then everybody's favorite part, looking at actual code.

And finally we'll talk about Facebook's Relay library and why I prefer Apollo to it.

It's not pretty and no one should actually USE it, but it's got some examples as to how you can use apollo.
